### r/programming (if appropriate)

**Title:** Built an MCP server for Bluesky/AT Protocol - AI agents can now interact with decentralized social media

**Body:**
```markdown
I built a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables AI agents to interact with Bluesky and the AT Protocol. It's now available on npm as @atproto/mcp-server.

## What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol is a standard for connecting AI models to external tools and data sources. It uses JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio, making it language-agnostic and easy to integrate.

## Why AT Protocol?

AT Protocol is the decentralized social networking protocol behind Bluesky. Unlike centralized platforms, it gives users control over their data and allows for federated social networks.

## What I Built

A TypeScript-based MCP server that exposes 34 tools for interacting with Bluesky:

- Authentication and session management
- Post creation with rich text (hashtags, mentions, URLs)
- Social interactions (follow, block, likes, reposts)
- Search and discovery
- Batch operations for efficiency

The server works with Claude Desktop, VS Code Copilot, and other MCP-compatible applications.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g @atproto/mcp-server
```

## Technical Architecture

```
AI Agent (Claude, Copilot)
         ‚Üì
   JSON-RPC 2.0 / stdio
         ‚Üì
   MCP Server (Node.js/TypeScript)
         ‚Üì
   Shell Executor ‚Üí atproto CLI
         ‚Üì
   AT Protocol / Bluesky API
```

The server uses a shell executor pattern to leverage the existing battle-tested atproto CLI, ensuring reliability and security.

## Example Integration

**Claude Desktop config:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "atproto": {
      "command": "atproto-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

Then you can simply ask Claude: "Post 'Hello from AI!' to my Bluesky account" and it handles authentication, API calls, and error handling automatically.

## Security Considerations

- Uses app passwords (not main account password)
- Session tokens stored with AES-256-CBC encryption
- Respects AT Protocol rate limits with exponential backoff
- All operations require explicit user authentication

## Hacker News (Show HN)

**Title:** Show HN: MCP Server for Bluesky/AT Protocol

**Body:**
```
I built a Model Context Protocol server that gives AI agents access to Bluesky/AT Protocol. It provides 34 tools for authentication, posting, social interactions, search, and batch operations.

The server works with Claude Desktop, VS Code Copilot, and other MCP-compatible applications. Setup is simple - just install via npm and add a few lines to your MCP config.

Main use cases: AI-powered bots, content automation, research tools, and cross-platform integrations with decentralized social networks.

Technical stack: TypeScript/Node.js, JSON-RPC 2.0, uses existing atproto CLI as execution layer for reliability and security.

Would love feedback from the community on features, use cases, and integration approaches!

## Dev.to Blog Post Draft

**Title:** Introducing @atproto/mcp-server: Connect AI Agents to Bluesky

**Tags:** `#ai` `#mcp` `#bluesky` `#opensource`

**Draft:**
```markdown
I'm excited to announce the release of @atproto/mcp-server, a Model Context Protocol server that enables AI agents to interact with Bluesky and the AT Protocol.

## What is it?

@atproto/mcp-server is a standards-compliant MCP server that provides 34 tools for AI agents to interact with Bluesky. It works seamlessly with Claude Desktop, VS Code Copilot, and other MCP-compatible applications.

## Why Build This?

The intersection of AI agents and decentralized social networks is fascinating. As Bluesky and AT Protocol gain traction, there's a growing need for tools that let AI systems interact with these platforms programmatically.

Traditional API integrations require custom code for each use case. MCP provides a standardized way for AI agents to discover and use tools, making integration much simpler.
