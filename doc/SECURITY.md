# Security Summary for AT-bot

## Security Review Date
October 28, 2025

## Overview
AT-bot is a command-line tool for Bluesky authentication using the AT Protocol. This document summarizes the security measures implemented and any identified concerns.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Secure Password Handling
- **No password storage**: Passwords are never written to disk
- **Session-based authentication**: Only JWT tokens are stored
- **Read-only password input**: Uses `read -s` to prevent echo
- **Environment variable support**: Optional for automation, with warnings about secure usage

### 2. File Permissions
- **Session files**: Created with mode 600 (owner read/write only)
- **Prevents unauthorized access**: Only the user can read session tokens
- **Config directory**: Uses standard `~/.config/at-bot/` location

### 3. Input Validation and Sanitization
- **Safe variable assignment**: Uses `printf -v` instead of `eval` for user input
- **JSON parsing**: Custom helper function with fallback handling
- **Read validation**: Checks for interactive terminal before reading input

### 4. Network Security
- **HTTPS-only**: All API communications use HTTPS (bsky.social)
- **No credential transmission over insecure channels**
- **Bearer token authentication**: Uses industry-standard JWT tokens

### 5. Code Quality
- **POSIX compliance**: Follows shell scripting best practices
- **ShellCheck validation**: All scripts pass shellcheck with no critical issues
- **Set -e**: Scripts fail fast on errors
- **Proper quoting**: Variables are properly quoted to prevent injection

## Static Analysis Results

### ShellCheck
- **Status**: ✅ Passed
- **Warnings**: None (informational messages only about file sourcing)
- **Security issues**: None identified

### Manual Security Review
- **eval usage**: Eliminated in favor of `printf -v`
- **Command injection**: No instances found
- **Path traversal**: Not applicable (only uses standard config directory)
- **Race conditions**: Minimal risk (single-user, sequential operations)

## Potential Security Considerations

### 1. Session Token Storage
- **Risk**: Tokens stored in plaintext (encrypted with mode 600)
- **Mitigation**: File permissions prevent other users from reading
- **Recommendation**: Users should use app passwords, not main account passwords

### 2. Environment Variables
- **Risk**: BLUESKY_PASSWORD in environment could be visible to other processes
- **Mitigation**: Documentation warns against use in untrusted environments
- **Recommendation**: Only use for automation in secure, isolated environments

### 3. Terminal History
- **Risk**: Commands with credentials might be logged in shell history
- **Mitigation**: Tool uses interactive prompts by default
- **Recommendation**: Users should not pass credentials as command-line arguments

### 4. API Endpoint Trust
- **Risk**: Hardcoded trust of bsky.social endpoint
- **Mitigation**: Uses official Bluesky PDS, HTTPS required
- **Note**: ATP_PDS environment variable allows override (documented risk)

## Dependencies
- **curl**: Trusted, widely-used tool for HTTP operations
- **bash**: System shell, assumed to be secure
- **grep, sed**: Standard POSIX utilities

## Vulnerability Scan Results
- **CodeQL**: Not applicable (shell scripts not supported)
- **Manual review**: No vulnerabilities identified

## Recommendations for Users

1. **Use app passwords**: Generate app-specific passwords in Bluesky settings
2. **Protect session files**: Do not share or copy `~/.config/at-bot/session.json`
3. **Regular logout**: Use `at-bot logout` when done to clear sessions
4. **Secure systems only**: Only install on trusted, properly secured systems
5. **Keep updated**: Update to latest version for security fixes

## Compliance
- **Data protection**: No personal data stored except session tokens
- **Privacy**: No telemetry or external reporting
- **Transparency**: All code is open source and auditable

## Incident Response
If a security vulnerability is discovered:
1. Email maintainers directly (do not open public issue)
2. Include detailed description and reproduction steps
3. Allow reasonable time for patch development
4. Coordinate disclosure timing

## Conclusion
AT-bot implements appropriate security measures for a command-line authentication tool. No critical security vulnerabilities were identified during review. The tool follows security best practices for shell scripting and credential handling.

**Security Status**: ✅ APPROVED
