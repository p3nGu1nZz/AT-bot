# Development Session - October 28, 2025 (Part 2)
## Engagement Features: Reply, Like, Repost & Session Management

---

## 🎯 Session Overview

This session focused on implementing **engagement features** and **session management** improvements to make AT-bot a fully-functional social media CLI tool. We added threading support through replies, content engagement through likes and reposts, and automatic session refresh for reliability.

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. **Session Refresh Capability** ✅
**Automatic Token Management**
- Proactive session refresh before expiration
- Manual refresh command added
- Session validation function
- Age-based refresh logic (refreshes after 1.5 hours)

**Implementation:**
- `refresh_session()` - Uses AT Protocol's refreshJwt
- `validate_session()` - Checks session validity
- `get_access_token()` - Enhanced with auto-refresh
- CLI command: `at-bot refresh`

### 2. **Reply Functionality** ✅
**Threading Support**
- Reply to existing posts
- Proper parent/root tracking
- Thread hierarchy maintained
- Full AT Protocol threading spec

**Implementation:**
- Enhanced `atproto_post()` with reply parameter
- Automatic parent post fetching
- Root post determination for threads
- CLI command: `at-bot reply <uri> <text>`

### 3. **Like Functionality** ✅
**Content Engagement**
- Like any post by URI
- Creates app.bsky.feed.like records
- Proper CID resolution
- Error handling for invalid posts

**Implementation:**
- `atproto_like()` function
- Post details fetching for CID
- CLI command: `at-bot like <uri>`

### 4. **Repost Functionality** ✅
**Content Amplification**
- Repost any post by URI
- Creates app.bsky.feed.repost records
- Same robust error handling as likes
- Full AT Protocol compliance

**Implementation:**
- `atproto_repost()` function
- CID-based post referencing
- CLI command: `at-bot repost <uri>`

### Overall Project Progress: 35% (15/40 tasks)

**New Total:**
- CLI Commands: **12** (login, logout, refresh, whoami, post, reply, like, repost, feed, follow, unfollow, search)
- Core Functions: **20+** in lib/atproto.sh
- Test Suites: **6** (all passing 100%)
- Lines of Code: **1,230** (lib/atproto.sh)

---

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Session Refresh Architecture

```bash
get_access_token() {
    # 1. Read session file
    # 2. Check if refresh token exists
    # 3. Calculate session age
    # 4. If older than 1.5 hours → refresh
    # 5. Return access token
}

refresh_session() {
    # 1. Get refresh token from session
    # 2. Call refreshSession API with bearer auth
    # 3. Update session file with new tokens
    # 4. Touch file to update age tracking
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Seamless user experience (no re-login needed)
- Long-running operations don't fail
- Automatic retry on token expiration
- Manual refresh option available

### Reply Implementation

```bash
atproto_post() {
    local text="$1"
    local reply_to="$2"  # Optional AT-URI
    
    if [ -n "$reply_to" ]; then
        # Fetch parent post
        # Determine root post (for threading)
        # Build reply record with parent/root refs
    else
        # Build simple post record
    fi
}
```

**AT Protocol Compliance:**
- Proper `reply` object structure
- Both `parent` and `root` references
- Thread hierarchy preserved
- CID-based linking

### Engagement Features (Like/Repost)

Both follow the same pattern:
```bash
atproto_like/repost() {
    # 1. Validate post URI
    # 2. Extract DID and rkey
    # 3. Fetch post to get CID
    # 4. Create like/repost record
    # 5. Link via URI + CID
}
```

**Robust Error Handling:**
- Invalid URI detection
- Post not found handling
- CID extraction validation
- Clear user feedback

# Output: URI: at://did:plc:.../app.bsky.feed.post/abc123

# Someone replies - you can engage
at-bot like at://did:plc:.../app.bsky.feed.post/xyz789
at-bot repost at://did:plc:.../app.bsky.feed.post/xyz789
at-bot reply at://did:plc:.../app.bsky.feed.post/xyz789 "Thanks for sharing!"
```

### Workflow 2: Long-Running Session
```bash
# Login in the morning
at-bot login

# Work all day - session automatically refreshes
at-bot post "Morning update"
# ... 2 hours later ...
at-bot post "Afternoon progress"  # Token auto-refreshed!
# ... 4 hours later ...
at-bot post "Evening wrap-up"     # Another auto-refresh!

# Manual refresh if needed
at-bot refresh
```

### Workflow 3: Complete Social Interaction

## 🎨 Design Patterns & Best Practices

### 1. Consistent Error Handling
```bash
# Pattern used everywhere
if [ -z "$required_param" ]; then
    error "Parameter required"
    echo "Usage: command <param>"
    return 1
fi
```

### 2. Automatic Recovery
```bash
# Session refresh is transparent
access_token=$(get_access_token)  # May trigger refresh
# User doesn't see refresh happening
```

### 3. Idempotent Operations
```bash
# Safe to call multiple times
refresh_session  # Won't break if called repeatedly
```

### 4. Progressive Enhancement
```bash
# Core post function enhanced, not replaced
atproto_post "$text"              # Simple post
atproto_post "$text" "$reply_uri" # Reply
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Session Management Security
- ✅ Refresh tokens stored securely (600 permissions)
- ✅ Tokens never exposed in error messages
- ✅ Debug mode shows operation flow, not tokens
- ✅ Session validation before operations
- ✅ Automatic expiration handling

### Engagement Security
- ✅ URI validation before operations
- ✅ CID verification prevents tampering
- ✅ Authentication required for all operations
- ✅ Rate limit aware (automatic retry logic ready)
