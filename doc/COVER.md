## Critical Security & Privacy Information

### Credential Handling

**What AT-bot Does:**
✅ Encrypts credentials using **AES-256-CBC**  
✅ Stores encrypted data with **600 file permissions** (owner read/write only)  
✅ **Never stores plaintext passwords**  
✅ Supports **app passwords** (recommended)  
✅ Separates encryption **keys per machine**  

**What You Should Do:**
✅ Create **app passwords** in Bluesky Settings → Privacy & Security  
✅ Use **app passwords with AT-bot** (never main password)  
✅ **Protect your credentials file** (~/.config/at-bot/)  
✅ Never **commit credentials to version control**  
✅ **Rotate app passwords** periodically  

**What You Should NOT Do:**
❌ Never use your **main Bluesky password**  
❌ Never **share credential files**  
❌ Never **commit to git** unencrypted credentials  
❌ Never **store in environment variables** on shared systems  
❌ Never **run on untrusted systems** with your credentials  

### For Production Deployments

Consider using dedicated secret management:
- **HashiCorp Vault** - Enterprise secret management
- **AWS Secrets Manager** - Cloud-based secrets
- **Azure Key Vault** - Microsoft cloud solution
- **System Keyring** - Platform-specific (planned for AT-bot)

### Security Review

For detailed security analysis, see:
- [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) - Security guidelines and best practices
- [ENCRYPTION.md](../doc/ENCRYPTION.md) - Encryption implementation details
- [DEBUG_MODE.md](../doc/DEBUG_MODE.md) - Debug mode security considerations
